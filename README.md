# PennySum
##About it
A web-based application to help you achieve your charity goals by donating small amounts from your daily purchases to those in need. A small amount can make a big difference, and that's what inspired us to take on this project.
##How it works
The user can enter a goal to be met per week, bi-week, or month. We'll round up your small purchases to the nearest number and donate the amount to an organization that could provide shelter and food to many. We'll only consider rounding up if there's an insignificant difference between the nearest number. At the end of the day, we'll try to reach our daily goal, that'll ultimately lead to the final goal.
##How to use
1) Download the project, install the dependencies, go to the source folder, and hit "python app.py"

2) Enter http://localhost:5000 in your browser window to reach our login page.

3) Use the username: test_capital and password: 1234 to login and reach the landing page.
